# Database description
The goal of my project to to understand how people are feeling about this pandemic around the world (or possibly here around the US). How each part of the global is facing different challenges and what not. My new data base will now hold three tables one for tweets, sentiment, and the last for Users followers. I will be streaming twitter data listening for the covid19 keyword and will save the tweets in a csv file. I will then import them to MySQL database tweets table. Then each record in the table will be sent off for analysis and the result will be saved in the sentiment table. The last table will hold usersâ€™ followers. This table will help keep track the impact of the tweet. For example are a lot of people seeing this tweet which can change their opinion. Which category of users is this tweet reaching.
